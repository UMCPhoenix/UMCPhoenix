## <ins> Hello there </ins> ðŸ‘‹
welcome to my ReadMe,
my name is Ian McLaughlin and the purpose of the repository is to describe myself and give examples of some of the things I am working on.

I am currently still trying to figure out the best configuration for this README, 
so any comments on how to make it better would be very beneficial. Thank you!

## <ins> About me </ins>? âš¡
My name is Ian McLaughlin I am currenlty 25 years old and I am currently a computer science student at the 
University of Southern Maine. I am moving into my senior year and am very confused about
my own direction as I have been in and out of school for the past 7 years. This is due to my fincial duties and covid getting in the way. 
I intend to do the best for society and my family. I want to succeed
well wherever I am. However I am not yet specific in the direction that I want to be in.
I hope that Github can connect with me with other people, experiences, and things I don't know
about yet. Whether that connecting me with new friends or employers but also similar interests. 


## <ins> Projects </ins>ðŸŒ±
I plan to work on some small projects to get me more comfortable coding again as I have not consistencly done it. 
Some of these projects maybe something small for myself use. Or they may be student objectives. 

### Computer Projects
- **Yearly Reflection Journal**: A tool for recording and reflecting on yearly goals and achievements.

### Other Projects
- **End**: A comic and story I have been working on over the past two years. I would like to have it recorded on github as well!
